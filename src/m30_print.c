/* m30_print.c -- the VDI on the printer, and the page off the machine.
 *
 * The THIRD device through src/vdi/vdidev.h's seam, and the first that
 * is not a screen: 640 x 800 dots at one bit, in far memory, drawn by
 * the same src/vdi/vdi.c that draws the other two and then written out
 * by src/vdi/emit.c as PCL 5 and as PostScript.
 *
 * There is nothing to photograph, so this milestone is checked from the
 * FILES IT WRITES.  PCL is lossless -- tools/emitref.py decodes it back
 * to a page -- and PostScript is checked by giving it to Ghostscript,
 * which is the only honest way to check a program in a language that has
 * an interpreter.  Both are compared against tools/vdiref.py driving
 * tools/devref.py's Printer, the same models that answer for the VBXE in
 * test-m3 and for ANTIC in test-m25, with one argument changed.
 *
 * WHY IT WRITES TWICE.  pr_kind and pr_dest are what src/gem.c sets out
 * of GEM4XE.CFG, and setting them here rather than reading a config file
 * is the point: the VDI does not know what a config file is, and a gate
 * that had to reboot the machine to try the second language would be
 * testing DOS.
