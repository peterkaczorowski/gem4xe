/* m27_ctx.c -- the context switch on its own, before anything depends on it.
 *
 * src/sys/ctx.c parks a context by copying its extent of the one engine
 * stack into far memory and copying it back at the same addresses when
 * the context runs again.  Two things have to be true for that to be
 * worth building on, and neither of them is visible from the outside of
 * a working desktop:
 *
 *   THE TURNS HAPPEN IN THE ORDER THEY WERE ASKED FOR.  The runner
 *   records who ran, in sequence, in a plain array the host reads by
 *   symbol.  A switch that silently did nothing, or that came back to
 *   the wrong context, shows up as a different sequence and not as a
 *   crash.
 *
 *   A FRAME SURVIVES A SWITCH FROM UNDERNEATH IT.  A context that
 *   switches at the bottom of a recursion has to find its locals intact
 *   on the way back out, at every level.  So one of the two contexts
 *   recurses, writes a value derived from the depth into a local and
 *   into an array, switches away from the deepest frame, and checks each
 *   local against the array as the recursion unwinds.  That is the whole
 *   claim the design rests on -- the extent goes back to the SAME
 *   addresses, so a pointer into a frame is still the address it was --
 *   and a copy that were off by one byte, or short, would fail it.
 *
 * The runner also leaves the measured park sizes where the gate can
 * print them: what a switch actually costs is a number this project
 * would rather measure than argue about.
