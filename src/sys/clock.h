/* clock.h -- the machine's clock, for GEMDOS's Tgetdate and Tgettime.
 *
 * The Atari has no clock of its own.  Two of the cards this machine may
 * have do: the Ultimate 1MB at $D3E2 and the SIDE / SIDE 2 at $D5E2, the
 * same DS1305 wired the same way, bit-banged through that one register
 * (docs/phase15.md).  A machine with neither is asked through its DOS,
 * which knows any clock it loaded a driver for (a SpartaDOS kernel call,
 * clock.c).  A machine with none of that says so and GEMDOS answers the
 * ST's epoch, 1 January 1980, which is what a TOS with a dead clock
 * answers as well.
 *
 * Which register -- if either -- is settled ONCE, by a READ-ONLY test,
 * before anything is written to it.  The reason is in clock.c and it is
 * not a small one: $D3E2 on a machine without a U1MB is the PIA
 * mirrored, and writing to it stops the mouse.
