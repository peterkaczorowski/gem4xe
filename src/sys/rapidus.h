/* rapidus.h -- the accelerator's speed map for bank $00.
 *
 * A Rapidus runs its 65C816 at ~20 MHz from its own SDRAM, but bank $00 is
 * the motherboard's 64 KB, and every access to it waits for the 1.79 MHz bus
 * -- unless the board's SRAM is switched in over it.  The Memory Control
 * Register in bank $FF divides bank $00 into four 16 KB windows, each either
 * SLOW (reads and writes go to the motherboard) or FAST (reads come from a
 * copy in SRAM).  Write-through keeps the copy coherent: with it on, a write
 * lands in both, at motherboard speed.  For $0000-$3FFF alone, CMCR bit 6
 * drops the write-through, so writes there are fast too and the motherboard
 * copy goes stale.
 *
 * The board comes up with every window slow, and gem4xe ran that way through
 * six phases without knowing: the code was in fast SDRAM, but under the small
 * data model every global, the stack and the direct page are in bank $00, so
 * a glyph blit that should take microseconds took 6 ms.  It surfaced as
 * form_do missing the second click of a double-click.
 *
 * WHICH WINDOWS GO FAST is not written down here; it follows from the map:
 *   - the window(s) holding the VBXE MEMAC window MUST stay slow.  MEMAC
 *     substitutes VRAM for motherboard RAM on the bus; a fast window never
 *     reaches the bus and would read the SRAM copy instead of VRAM.
 *   - $C000-$FFFF is left as found by THIS file: OS ROM and hardware.
 *     src/sys/irq.c switches it fast once its SRAM holds the RAM copy of
 *     the OS with the native-mode vectors patched, and back on exit.
 *   - $0000-$3FFF drops write-through only if the linker really did put the
 *     direct page, the stack and the data there -- checked, not assumed.
 *   - everything else goes fast-read, coherent by write-through.
 *
 * COHERENCE: if write-through was OFF when this runs, the SRAM copy of a slow
 * window may be stale (DOS loaded the program with the CPU, and those writes
 * only reached the motherboard).  Each window about to go fast is then
 * re-synced by copying it onto itself with write-through on and the window
 * still slow: reads come from the motherboard, writes land in both.
 *
 * THE WAY BACK: once $0000-$3FFF stops writing through, the motherboard
 * copy of the OS variables, DOS and the direct page is stale.  A return to
 * DOS in 6502 mode has to write it back first -- rapidus_restore() clears
 * CMCR bit 6 and copies the window onto itself again, then puts the MCR's
 * speed bits back as they were found.  sys_exit() (src/crt_atari.s) is the
 * only caller, after irq_remove() has given the OS ROM back.
