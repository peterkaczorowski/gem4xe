/* cio.h -- the Atari OS's CIO, from gem4xe.
 *
 * gem4xe has no file system of its own and wants none: DOS is resident,
 * and every disk it can read -- ATR, SIO2SD, a hard disk behind a PBI --
 * is behind CIO's D: device.  What is here is the thin layer over an
 * IOCB: pick a free one, fill it in, call, read the status back.  The
 * call itself is the round trip into emulation mode that the OS needs
 * (src/sys/cio.s), which is why every CIO call costs what a mode switch
 * costs and why the layer above -- rsrc_load, fsel_input, shel_find --
 * reads in big pieces rather than a byte at a time.
 *
 * Addresses are the OS's, as the Altirra source has them
 * (src/h/at/atcore/ksyms.h, cio.h): the IOCBs at $0340, sixteen bytes
 * each, eight of them; IOCB 0 is the OS's own, E:, and is left alone.
 *
 * Buffers and names must be in bank $00 -- CIO takes a 16-bit address.
 * The small data model's plain pointers are bank $00 by construction, so
 * the types say so.  Names are copied into a buffer here with the EOL the
 * OS wants appended; a name without a device ("TEST.RSC") gets "D:".
 *
 * Statuses are the OS's own: 1 is success, $88 end of file, $AA file
 * not found (cio.h in the Altirra source lists them all).  The functions
 * return the status; cio_open returns the IOCB number instead, or the
 * status negated, so that a caller can tell the two apart.
