;;; src/sys/irq.s points the native-mode COP vector at gem_cop, which is
;;; the ABI's entry (src/sys/abi.s) -- an application's way into the AES.
;;; A VDI milestone has no application and no AES, so linking abi.o would
;;; drag in the whole of both.  A COP here is a program that has gone
;;; wrong; returning is as good an answer as any.

;;; The four words below are the call gate's, which a context carries
;;; across a switch (src/sys/ctx.c), and app_run is how a context enters
;;; its program.  This runner has one process and never switches, so the
;;; words are never read and app_run is never called -- but the AES's
;;; event layer needs A process to exist, and the linker needs the
;;; symbols.  app_run answering zero is the honest stub: there is no
;;; program here to run.
