/* lang.c -- LANG.RSC: everything the system says, kept in far memory --
 * and, since a translation is no use in a character set that cannot
 * spell it, the SYSTEM.FNT beside it (src/vdi/font.c).  They are the
 * two files a translation ships, and two calls read them: lang_init()
 * the strings, which needs only far memory and so can run before there
 * is a GEM screen -- the boot screen (src/sys/bootinfo.c) is written in
 * them -- and lang_font() the face, which goes into the device and so
 * has to wait for one.
 *
 * The rule the project set itself is that no string a person reads is in
 * the C (docs/shipping.md, section 5).  The desktop's went into its own
 * resource in Phase 14; the SYSTEM's -- form_error's alerts, the shell's
 * two failures -- are here, as free strings of a resource that
 * tools/langrsc.py builds and a translator replaces.
 *
 * Far, and copied a string at a time.  The application pool is 14 KB and
 * an application's resource has to fit in it beside the desktop's, so a
 * kilobyte of alert text cannot live there; the resource sits in far
 * memory as the file's own bytes, unfixed (there are no trees in it to
 * fix), and lang_str() copies the one string being used into a near
 * buffer, which is what fm_alert wants.  ONE buffer: an alert is modal,
 * so no two of these are alive at once, and a caller that wants to keep
 * one past the next call must copy it.
 *
 * The file is optional.  A disk without LANG.RSC gets the same English
 * from build/lang_rsc.c -- the identical bytes, linked into the far
 * image -- because a system that cannot say "this application cannot be
 * found" because its language file is missing is worse than one that
 * says it in English.  So the file OVERRIDES; it is not required.
 *
 * What it will not do is fix up trees.  The file selector's dialog is
 * still built into the far image (tools/fselrsc.py) for the pool reason
 * in tools/langrsc.py's header, so a translation cannot widen it yet.
