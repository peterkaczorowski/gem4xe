/* pointer.h -- the pointing-device seam.
 *
 * Everything above this produces and consumes ONE thing: an absolute screen
 * position plus button state.  Below it sit devices that disagree
 * fundamentally about how position works:
 *
 *   ST mouse, Amiga mouse, CX80 trak-ball   RELATIVE -- quadrature on the
 *                                           joystick direction lines, read
 *                                           through PORTA, deltas integrated
 *   Touch tablet (CX77), KoalaPad           ABSOLUTE -- POT0/POT1, one
 *                                           position per POKEY pot scan
 *   mouSTer (USB adapter) in XEM1 mode      RELATIVE, but COUNTED BY THE
 *                                           DEVICE -- 7-bit position
 *                                           counters on the POT lines, so
 *                                           one pot scan per frame is enough
 *
 * GEM's own design already assumes this seam: `vex_motv` hands the AES an
 * absolute position and `v_locator` is a device-independent locator, so
 * nothing above here ever learns which device is fitted.
 *
 * A relative device needs frequent sampling or it loses quadrature counts
 * -- the classic Atari 8-bit mouse complaint -- which means an interrupt.
 * Since Phase 9 there is one: src/sys/irq.h shadows the OS ROM into RAM,
 * fills the 65816's native-mode vectors, and runs a POKEY timer at ~4 kHz
 * that samples PORTA and decodes both axes through tables THIS file fills
 * in per device (ptr_pair, lines_select).  The relative back ends take the
 * counters' difference each poll.  If the interrupt regime could not be
 * installed (irq.how == IRQ_OFF) they fall back to decoding the one
 * sample a poll gives, through the same tables, and lose counts as before.
 * The absolute back ends never needed it: one POT read per frame is
 * enough.  Nor does XEM1, where the adapter does the counting: the host
 * reads a position, not a phase, and a frame's movement is a difference
 * of two readings.  Its one demand is a POTGO at a steady cadence (the
 * sample driver says within ~100 cycles, every frame), which the polling
 * loop only approximates; moving it into the VBI is still to do.
 *
 * XEM1 is decoded from the mouSTer firmware's own sample driver
 * (Mad-Pascal samples/a8/mouSTer/vbl.asm), not from its prose, which calls
 * the readings "relative coordinate changes": the code subtracts the
 * previous reading, so they are counters.  Altirra does not emulate the
 * adapter; the decode is checked against tools/vdiref.py in the compiler's
 * simulator (tests/host/test_pointer.py) and has NOT met the hardware.
