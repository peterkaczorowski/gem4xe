/* vdi.h -- GEM VDI for gem4xe.
 *
 * Structure follows the Digital Research / EmuTOS screen driver: a fixed
 * parameter block of five arrays, a flat jump table indexed by opcode, and
 * handlers that take no arguments and read the globals.
 *
 * That 1984 ABI is a gift on this machine.  DRI's own entry.a86 copies the
 * caller's arrays into driver-owned globals and runs the whole VDI on a
 * private 256-byte stack; every handler is `void f(void)`.  Nothing here needs
 * argument passing, and nothing needs reentrancy.
 *
 * Only the 37 opcodes the AES and the GEM Desktop actually use are planned;
 * DRI's own shipping driver v_nop'd ten opcodes and so do we.
