/* font.h -- the system font, and loading another one.
 *
 * gem4xe links one 8x8 face (src/vdi/font8x8.c, EmuTOS's Atari ST set) and
 * expands it into VRAM as glyph masks.  A translation usually needs a
 * different CHARACTER SET rather than a different size -- Latin-2 for Polish
 * and Czech, Cyrillic, Greek -- so what is loadable here is the strip: a GEM
 * .FNT file whose cell is the same 8x8 and whose 2 KB of glyphs replace the
 * linked ones (docs/shipping.md, section 5).
 *
 * The cell does not change, and that is a decision rather than an oversight.
 * The AES's geometry is in character cells (gl_wchar, gl_hchar) and is asked
 * for once at start-up; the blitter has no shifter, so every glyph is also a
 * pre-shifted second copy in VRAM; and the host reference draws the same
 * cells.  A face of another SIZE is all of that again, and would earn its
 * place only when there is something to do with it.  A face of another
 * ALPHABET is 2 KB and a file.
