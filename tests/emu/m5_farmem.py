"""Gate: linear RAM above bank $00 is found by probing, not by assumption.

gem4xe requires a 65C816 with linear RAM.  Rapidus and Antonia both provide it
and disagree about the map, so farmem_probe() writes each bank's own number
into it and reads them all back -- which sizes real RAM and rejects mirrors
without knowing anything about the board.

Only Rapidus can be tested here: Altirra does not emulate Antonia.  What this
gate proves is that the METHOD works and needs no board-specific knowledge, so
an untested board with linear RAM should work on the same code path.
