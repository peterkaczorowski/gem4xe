"""Phase 36 gate: the VDI on the printer, and the page off the machine.

The THIRD device through src/vdi/vdidev.h's seam and the first that is
not a screen.  The same src/vdi/vdi.c that draws on the VBXE in test-m3
and on ANTIC in test-m25 draws 640 x 800 dots into far memory here, and
src/vdi/emit.c writes them out through v_updwk as PCL 5 and PostScript.

THERE IS NOTHING TO PHOTOGRAPH, so this gate is checked from the FILES
THE ATARI WROTE.  They land in a host directory by way of Altirra's H:
device, which is what PRINTTO= would name on a machine with a FujiNet,
and then:

  * the PCL is decoded back to a page -- PCL 5 raster is lossless and
    tools/emitref.py's decoder is strict enough to have caught the bug --
    and compared with tools/vdiref.py driving tools/devref.py's Printer,
    all 512,000 dots of it;
  * the PCL is also compared BYTE FOR BYTE with the model's, so the
    blank-row skip and the escape sequences are pinned and not merely
    plausible;
  * the PostScript is handed to GHOSTSCRIPT, rendered at 100 dpi, and
    the bitmap that comes back is compared with the same page.  That is
    the only honest check of a program written in a language that has an
    interpreter: it catches the y-flip, the DeviceGray inversion and the
    image matrix, none of which fails visibly and all of which would be
    discovered on paper otherwise.

Neither model was written for a printer and neither was edited for one.
