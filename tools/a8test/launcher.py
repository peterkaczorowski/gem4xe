"""Launch AltirraSDL headless for the gem4xe target machine.

    emu = launch(tag="p0")           # 800XL, VBXE FX1.26 @ $D640, Rapidus 65C816
    emu.bridge.frames(60)
    emu.stop()

Differences from the vbxetxtadv launcher this is derived from:
  * adds the Rapidus 65C816 accelerator (--adddevice rapidus)
  * memsize defaults to 1088K so PORTB banking is present for MEMAC coexistence tests
  * U1MB is off by default and pinned off in BASE_ARGS (see --noultimate1mb
    below); a gate that wants it passes --u1mbrom, which the patched
    emulator in tools/altirra/ understands (docs/phase14.md, and
    tests/emu/cf_boot.py for the machine that needs all of it).

Never opens a window.  Never uses `pkill -f`: the emulator is stopped by pid.

The host's joysticks are kept out of the machine.  AltirraSDL opens every
joystick-class device SDL can see and routes it to port 1 through its input
maps, and a keyboard or mouse with a stray HID "joystick" interface (a
Keychron Q6 Max reports a one-axis controller whose axis sits below its own
minimum, which SDL reads as full left) then holds a PORTA direction line low
for the whole run -- found when the CX80 gate counted every pulse backwards.
The ports are driven through the bridge, so launch() enumerates the host's
joystick devices from sysfs and hands SDL their ids as a blacklist.

# --u1mbrom comes later on the line and wins.  Only the patched emulator

# --diskemu generic: the drive the gates run.  This said "fastestpossible"
# for thirteen phases, which is not one of the emulator's names for a mode
# (disk.cpp's enum table says "fastest") -- it was rejected with one line
# in the log and every gate ran the generic drive anyway.  Asking for

# boot at all, where under "generic" it is up in 400 frames.  So the gates
# say what they have always actually run, and a 92 KB load costs its five
# thousand frames.
# The video standard is not here: launch() puts --pal or --ntsc in front of
# these by its `pal` argument.  Every gate ran PAL until the NTSC one
# (test-m32n), because the frame is what evnt_timer and the double-click
# window are measured in and a 20 ms tick assumed on a 16.7 ms machine is
